‘Corporate’s deterrent: attrition rates in your firm’ allows firms to predict the attrition rates within their organization on the basis of their employees' trends. The user may upload his/her firm’s employees’ data, after which the app will observe the trends and predict the attrition rate within the organization. Furthermore, the user may also analyze the reasons for the current attrition rates in his firm using the app’s analyzing tools and check suggestions to reduce this attrition rate based on the analysis. The step-by-step procedure to use the app is as follows:
1)	Upload employee data: Upon clicking this button, user will see the option to upload any document from his/her files. He/She may then select any file which contains data regarding the employees in his/her organization and upload it using the ‘open button as shown on his/her screen. It must be noted that the data should contain certain parameters like employee ID, Department, Job Role, Gender, Age, Marital Status, Experience, Monthly Salary, Business Travel, and distance from home. It is preferred that the data be presented in excel form.

2)	Predict attrition rate: After the user has uploaded his/her employee data, he/she may click on this button to check the attrition rates on the basis of the dataset uploaded. The app will analyze the data and predict the attrition rates based on the information given under different parameters using different machine learning models like the random forest classifier, the Gaussian NB neighbors model, etc.. The button will redirect the user to another page which will show him/her the attrition rate in his/her organization a few places above the bottom, along with the process by which it was calculated. Furthermore, the page shall also show the confidence level in the statistical findings. This may help the user to analyze the findings accordingly. Moreover, the attrition rates of a sample dataset have been displayed for the user’s convenience, in order to know what to expect. The findings can change as per the latest dataset uploaded. Please note that even though this is supposed to be a speedy process, it might occasionally take some time for the program to present its findings. This may be due to the size of the file uploaded or if any missing values are present in the dataset. Nevertheless, the findings shall be displayed within a suitable timing.

3)	After the user has predicted the attrition rates within his/her firm, he/she may then click on this button, after doing so, he/she will be redirected to a page which will graphically display the reasons for the current attrition rate. The user may then save this information on any other application for future reference. Please note that while the reasons may be stated, they are not saved on the app. Once another dataset is uploaded and analyzed, the information for the previous dataset will be cleared automatically. Hence users are advised to separately note down the information displayed on the app before moving on to another dataset. This precaution also applies to the other three buttons.


4)	After the user has analyzed the reasons for attrition, he/she may click on this button to  check the suggestions to reduce attrition among the organization's employees. These recommendations shall be presented on a new page, following the same procedure as the previous button However, please note that these recommendations are  computer-generated with no human interference, and hence may be subject to consideration for reference depending upon the firm’s unique circumstances. The same precaution applies to the previous button also. Both these commands are computer generated and hence may present standardized responses.
